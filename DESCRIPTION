Description: A flexible framework for building and using vector-based dictionaries
    (vec-tionaries) for text and image analysis. Build custom dictionaries from word embeddings
    (FastText, word2vec, GloVe) or multi-modal embeddings (SigLIP) by providing seed words
    with scores on dimensions of interest (e.g., moral foundations, sentiment, emotions).
    Multi-modal vectionaries enable cross-modal analysis: text dictionaries can analyze images
    in the shared embedding space. Users download embeddings separately and build lightweight
    vec-tionaries that can be shared and reused without requiring the original large embedding files.
    Text-based analysis uses R-only code. Image embedding and analysis require Python with the
    'transformers' library installed and accessible via the 'reticulate' package.
