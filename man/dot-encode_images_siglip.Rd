\title{Encode image files using SigLIP image encoder (internal)}
\usage{
.encode_images_siglip(
  image_paths,
  model = NULL,
  model_name = "google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384",
  normalize = TRUE,
  batch_size = 32L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{image_paths}{Character vector of paths to image files (JPEG, PNG, etc.)}

\item{model}{Named list from [.load_siglip_model()]. If NULL (default), loads
the model automatically using the default model name.}

\item{model_name}{SigLIP model ID (default: "google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384").
Only used when model = NULL.}

\item{normalize}{Logical. If TRUE (default), normalizes each embedding to unit
length (L2 norm = 1). SigLIP embeddings are designed to be unit-normalized;
this ensures projections are cosine-similarity-based.}

\item{batch_size}{Integer. Number of images to encode per batch (default: 32).
Reduce if running out of memory. Larger batches are faster on GPU.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix of shape (length(image_paths) x 512). Row names are
  set to basename(image_paths).
}
\description{
Encodes a character vector of image file paths into 512-dimensional vectors
using the SigLIP image encoder. The resulting vectors live in the same shared
text-image embedding space as the text embeddings, so images can be scored by
vectionaries whose axes were learned from text.

Requires Python with the transformers, torch, and Pillow libraries.
See [vectionary_builder()] for setup instructions.
