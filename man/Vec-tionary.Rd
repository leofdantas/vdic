\title{Vec-tionary S3 Class}
\description{
An S3 class representing a vector-based dictionary (vec-tionary).
Contains axes in embedding space and methods for analyzing text.
}
\details{
Vectionary objects are created by [vectionary_builder()].
They provide methods to compute various metrics on text:
\itemize{
  \item `$mean(text)` - Arithmetic mean of projections
  \item `$mse(text)` - Mean squared error (emphasizes high-magnitude projections)
  \item `$sd(text)` - Standard deviation of projections
  \item `$se(text)` - Standard error of the mean
  \item `$top_10(text)` - Mean of 10 highest projections (strongest signals)
  \item `$top_20(text)` - Mean of 20 highest projections (strongest signals)
  \item `$metrics(text)` - All metrics at once
  \item `$diagnose(n, dimension)` - Diagnostic report (see [vectionary_diagnose()])
}

Stopwords are automatically removed at build time based on the
\code{language} parameter passed to [vectionary_builder()].
Use \code{remove_stopwords = FALSE} to include stopwords.
