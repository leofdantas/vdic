Description: A flexible framework for building and using vector-based dictionaries
    (vec-tionaries) for text analysis. Build custom dictionaries from word embeddings
    by providing seed words with scores on dimensions of interest (e.g., moral foundations,
    sentiment, emotions). Users download embeddings separately and build lightweight vec-tionaries
    that can be shared and reused without requiring the original large embedding files.
