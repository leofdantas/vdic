\title{Solve for axis using Duan et al. (2025) constrained optimization}
\usage{
.solve_axis_duan(word_vectors, word_scores, dim_name = "default", seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{word_vectors}{List of embedding vectors for dictionary words}

\item{word_scores}{Numeric vector of scores for words on this dimension}

\item{dim_name}{Dimension name (combined with seed for per-dimension reproducibility)}

\item{seed}{Base seed passed from vectionary_builder()}
}
\value{
Numeric vector representing the learned axis (unit norm)
}
\description{
Learns a semantic axis using constrained nonlinear optimization as described
in Duan et al. (2025). Minimizes sum of squared errors subject to unit norm
constraint: min sum((w_i . m - s_i)^2) s.t. ||m|| = 1

This replicates the vMFD methodology for direct comparison. Note that this
method has no regularization, which may lead to overfitting in high-dimensional
embedding spaces.
