\title{Get word scores for a single document}
\usage{
.get_doc_scores(text, word_projections, dimensions)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{Character string (single document, not a vector)}

\item{word_projections}{Data frame with 'word' column and dimension columns.
Each row is a word from the embedding vocabulary with its projection score
onto each dimension axis.}

\item{dimensions}{Character vector of dimension names (column names in
word_projections to extract)}
}
\value{
Data frame with dimension columns, one row per word occurrence found.
  Words not in the vectionary's vocabulary are silently dropped.
}
\description{
Tokenizes a document and looks up each token's projection scores from
word_projections. Returns one row per token occurrence (if a word appears
3 times in the text, its scores appear 3 times in the output).

This is the single-document code path. For multiple documents, use
.batch_metric() which is more efficient (single match() call for all docs).
