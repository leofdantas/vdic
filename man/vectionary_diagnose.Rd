\title{Diagnose a vec-tionary}
\usage{
vectionary_diagnose(vectionary, n = 30, dimension = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{vectionary}{A vectionary object (from [vectionary_builder()])}

\item{n}{Number of top words to show per dimension (default: 30)}

\item{dimension}{Which dimension(s) to diagnose. If NULL (default), diagnoses
all dimensions. Can be a character vector of dimension names or a single name.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list of data frames (one per dimension) with columns:
  \code{rank}, \code{word}, \code{score}, \code{seed}.
}
\description{
Prints a diagnostic report for a vec-tionary, showing the top-scoring words
per dimension and whether the seed (dictionary) words rank near the top.
Useful for verifying that a vectionary is capturing the intended semantics.

\examples{
\dontrun{
vect <- vectionary_builder(dictionary, embeddings)
vectionary_diagnose(vect)
vectionary_diagnose(vect, n = 50, dimension = "care")
